minimalist system monitor

https://imgur.com/a/PTY7I8O Post varios samples

is not perfect

The problem i had is that the line graph doesn't follow the bar meter in the CPU or GPU, also the percentage with the line nor the bar fully match.
also the disks list the last one had to inversed them or they will not link correctly.

I like this system monitor over others like NZXT CAM uses 150Mb memory, because this only use 55Mb memory in total (22mb rainmeter/33Mb HWINFO i habe disable all other sensors that i dont need)

For this minimalist System monitor i use with HWINFO for the data, i have been using this for a long time, the links downloads i just google search them for the 3 skins i have been using.

The edits codes may be not clean i just modded over the original, it may have leftovers of the original that is not require or doesn't do anything.

*******ColdSys = for GPUGraph.ini / i use this one to get the samples for the code to retrieve info from HWINFO
